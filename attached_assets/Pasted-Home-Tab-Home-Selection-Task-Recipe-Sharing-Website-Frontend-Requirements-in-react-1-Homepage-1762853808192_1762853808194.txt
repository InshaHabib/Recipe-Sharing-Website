Welcome to Emergent - your single destination to build and deploy production-ready applications.

It looks like you're aiming to build a vibrant recipe-sharing platform with a smooth user experience for browsing, submitting, and managing recipes, all secured with user authentication. I'll make sure all those frontend and backend pieces fit together perfectly.

I'll start building this now!
